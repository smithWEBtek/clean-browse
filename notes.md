# Clean Browse

Provides a wrapper browser to filter out adsw, popups, overlays, clickbait, and other Internet annoyances.


## Functionality

  - REMOVE THIS 
  - We will collect CSS tags for things we want to remove.
As users use the app, they can click on a REMOV button, and whatever they click next will be absorbed into the array of hidden things.

  - Then an UNDO button will show, if they wish to show that item.

  - UNDO ALL
  - Essentially refreshes the page, showing everything again.

  - SOLO
  - If they know what the content is they wish to see, they can click an SOLO button which will render only that content in a separate window, cleaned from all the annoyances..
